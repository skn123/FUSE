This repository contains the code, synthetic data and real-world data used in the 2016 KDD paper "FUSE: Full Spectral Clustering". The code is written in matlab and tested successfully in Matlab 2015b. For the construction of locally scaled affinity matrix, I used the method proposed in ZP and its code can be found here: http://lihi.eew.technion.ac.il/files/Demos/SelfTuningClustering.html

If you have any questions, please contact Wei Ye (weiye@cs.ucsb.edu). Thanks for your interests.
